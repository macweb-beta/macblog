          Ify acquiered by MacWeb and renamed to MacWork!
        </div>
        <ul class="note-ul">
          <li>
            Ify was officially merged into MacWeb as MacWork, one of its apps!
            We are very excited to see more features, changes, improvements, and
            updates to come! Goodbye Ify, hello MacWork, the most powerful
            productivity app!
          </li>
          <li>
            All the features, appearance, and all the pages were entirely
            transformed into the new MacWork and the app organization was
            completely changed. We moved many pages around and deleted some
            unneccessary files and folders. Now you can have the easiest
            navigation between apps!
          </li>
          <li>
            We will still publish the complete and powerful versions of MacWork

            powerful text edits and MacText for powerful text modification!

            Docs can do anything a text editor can, and beyond! You can type
            paragraphs, format them into nice-looking articles, print them, add
            imges and media, put special effects, and more all on the app!
